Let's break it down.\n\n1)  **Where the student's thinking went wrong:**\n    Your mistake occurred in the very first step of manipulating the equation. You went from `2x + 3 = 7` to `2x = 7`.\n\n2)  **Explanation of the mistake:**\n    In algebra, whatever operation you perform on one side of the equation, you must perform the exact same operation on the other side to keep the equation balanced and true. When you had `2x + 3 = 7`, your goal was to isolate `2x`. To get rid of the `+3` on the left side, you correctly thought about subtracting `3`. However, you only subtracted `3` from the left side (`2x + 3 - 3` which gives `2x`), but you forgot to subtract `3` from the right side as well. The `7` on the right side should also have `3` subtracted from it.\n\n3)  **Hint:**\n    Think about what you need to do to *both sides* of the equation to \"undo\" the addition of 3 on the left side. Remember to apply that action consistently to maintain equality.\n\n---\n**Scores:**\n*   **Logic:** 3/10 - While you correctly identified the operation needed to get `x` alone at the end (division), the fundamental logical step of maintaining balance in an equation was missed.\n*   **Clarity:** 8/10 - Your steps are written clearly and are easy to follow, even with the error.\n*   **Understanding:** 4/10 - You understand the goal of isolating `x` and how to perform division, but there's a gap in understanding the core principle of performing operations equally on both sides of an equation.",

Let's take a look.\n\n**1) Identify where the student's thinking went wrong**\nYour algebraic steps are all correct, and you arrived at the correct answer! However, you missed an opportunity to simplify the expression on the left side of the equation *before* you started moving terms across the equals sign.\n\n**2) Explain the mistake**\nWhen you have multiple constant terms (numbers without variables) on one side of an equation, it's generally a good practice to combine them first to simplify that side of the equation. In the problem `5x + 3 - 2 = 8`, the terms `+3` and `-2` are both constants on the left side. Combining `3 - 2` would simplify the left side to `5x + 1`.\n\nInstead, you chose to move the `-2` to the right side (making it `+2`), and then move the `+3` to the right side (making it `-3`). While mathematically sound, doing `8 + 2 - 3` is a slightly longer path than simply `8 - 1` after simplifying the left side first. Both methods lead to the correct answer, but simplifying first can make the problem-solving process more efficient and reduce the chances of arithmetic errors.\n\n**3) Give a hint**\nBefore you begin to isolate the variable, always check if you can simplify each side of the equation by combining any like terms.\n\n**4) Give scores out of 10:**\n*   **Logic:** 9/10 - Your steps were logically sound in terms of algebraic manipulation, leading to the correct answer.
